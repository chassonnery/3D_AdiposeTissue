# Description of the movies

Each movie displays the temporal evolution of a system composed of a dense network ($\phi_{fib} = 0.5$) of long fibres ($L_{fib} = 6$) and a medium-sized population of cells ($\phi_{ad}=0.3$). The fibres are colored according to their alignment indicator, from blue ($Al_k=0$) to red ($Al_k=1$). Fibres with less than $40$ neighbours are colored in green. The cells are colored according to the index of the lobule to which they belong at the end of the simulation, with isolated cells in white.

The screen is divided in three panels showing, from left to right : the whole system (fibers and cells), only the fiber network, only the cells.

*Movie1.mp4* displays a quickly remodelling network ($\nu_{link}=0.1$) with low equilibrium linked fibre fraction ($\chi_{link}=0.1).

*Movie2.mp4* displays a quickly remodelling network ($\nu_{link}=0.1$) with high equilibrium linked fibre fraction ($\chi_{link}=0.8).

*Movie3.mp4* displays a slowly remodelling network ($\nu_{link}=0.001$) with low equilibrium linked fibre fraction ($\chi_{link}=0.1).

*Movie4.mp4* displays a slowly remodelling network ($\nu_{link}=0.001$) with high equilibrium linked fibre fraction ($\chi_{link}=0.8).
